This repository contains metadata (and some associated code) that I created for existing corpora, especially the [Buckeye Corpus](https://buckeyecorpus.osu.edu/), and [Switchboard](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62) (usually relying on the [MS State annotations](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/switchboard/)). You are welcome to use my metadata for academic and educational purposes, but please cite the appropriate paper. If you find any errors, please let me know.
